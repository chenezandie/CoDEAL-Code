# Covariate-Adjusted Deep Causal Learning for Heterogeneous Panel Data Models
Code for Covariate-Adjusted Deep Causal Learning for Heterogeneous Panel Data Models
In each example, we compare the performance in terms of MAE and MSE of our methods (CoDEAL) with 6 baseline methods.

## Directory Descriptions 
1. Example of four-block design with nonlinear covariate removed by DNN
2. Example of staggered adoption design with no covariate
3. Real Data example Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT)

The OxCGRT dataset is available at https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker
